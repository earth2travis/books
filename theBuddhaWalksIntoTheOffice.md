# The Buddha Walks Into the Office
A Guide to Livelihood for a New Generation

Lodro Rinzler

## Part One. Hinayana: Live With Purpose

### 1. Setting an Intention
With such a fixed idea of what she wants to be when she grows up, she could, I feared, be in for a lifetime of dissatisfaction.

explore her world without buying into the belief that she has to have it all figured out.

didn't let their job define who they are.

it was no so much a question of what they did as why they did it.

Knowing your intention is key in all things.

it's important to know why

it's helpful to have a strong reason you chose to pursue such a practice.

Similarly, it is important to know why we do what we do in other aspects of our life.

When it comes to figuring out a career path, knowing your intention may be the most basic and most helpful step on the journey that links your work with your spiritual path.

#### The Three Yanas

These three vehicles are the means to transport us from our confusion to awakening.

1. Hinayana. It is the path of learning to be authentic to yourself...about both your neurosis and your wisdom.
2. Mahayana. approaching your life and work from the perspective of what is good for everyone...being present and empathetic
3. Vajrayana. Our work and our role in society are all part of our spiritual journey. whatever occurs is a lesson we can learn and a way to improve ourselves as genuine people.

Through the practice of meditation, we are becoming familiar with ourselves, our aspirations, and our intentions.

#### The Power of Listening to Your Intention

If I become familiar with that intention in its current manifestation, then I find myself successful and happy. If I stray from it in an attempt to base my happiness solely in material gain like money or special benefits, they I may find some temporary satisfaction but end up exhausted and discontent in the long term.

Before we go into the office and work with others in a way that is of benefit, we first have to know ourselves well. Once we know ourselves well, we can be true to who we are. The first step is to know our intention--both large intentions, like knowing why we are engaging in our line of work, and smaller ones, such as knowing what we want to accomplish on a given day. This is the foundation of our path. This is the heart of the journey. Knowing our own intention, the why behind the what, is an important first step.

##### Contemplation for Setting Your Intention

When you first wake up in the morning, it might be helpful to reflect on your intention for that day.

Take a moment to reflect on what is is you want to make of your day, even before you get out of bed.

At the end of your day, sit down and reflect on how you did in manifesting your intention.

The more we are familiar with ourselves and our intention, the more we can find happiness in all aspects of our life, especially our work. From that point onward, you can, with all your heart, give yourself to it.

### 2. Discovering our Worthiness: An Introduction to Meditation Practice

That is the purpose of meditation practice: to become more present and aware of every aspect of our life.

Meditation practice helps us slow down and be present enough to recognize the small joys about our work as well as its frustrations.

A strong and flexible mind is an obvious asset both in determining what you want to do with your life and for performing well in your chosen livelihood.

After some time, he sat down under a tree and just did a simple meditation on his breath. It grounded him in the reality of the present moment, what is going on right now. Through that experience he achieved what is often referred to as enlightenment. What was he enlightened to? The reality of the way things are. He became able to see how things work in the world, the truths of how we suffer and create confusion for ourselves and others, and how he could stop doing that.

The more we can connect with the present in a calm way in our life and our work, the more we can be of use to the world around us. The more present we are, the less stressed-out we will be, and the more we can perform admirably, with a strong mind as our support.

#### Instructions for Meditation Practice
The most important thing to do before you begin practicing meditation is to relax.

So it may be helpful to ease into meditation. (tea or reading)

##### Environment
Simply having a meditation cushion in your home reminds you that you have the option of meditating.

It is important to set aside a place...where you consistently go to meditate.

You want to sit in an area of your home where you feel a sense of spaciousness.

When you sit down there, you want to fell like you are being supported but the environment, not that it is infringing on your state of mind.

##### Posture

There are six main points to remember when taking a good meditation posture.
1. Seat. You should feel that kind of dignity and upliftedness when you sit down to meditate.
2. Legs. loosly crossed with your knees falling a little lower than your hips.
3. Torso. leading up with your head.
4. Hands. palms down on your thighs.
5. Eyes. We keep our eyes open as a reminder that we are trying to wake up to our present experience.
6. Mouth. Keeping the mouth slightly open allows air to move more easily through your mouth and nose.

The overall point of this posture is to keep you upright feeling a sense of dignity, and yet relaxed.

##### Breath
You don't need to alter your breathing in any way; just bring your mind to it.

#### Come Back, Over and Over Again
thoughts will come up...come back to the breath.

It if is helpful, you can silently say *thinking* to yourself when a thought takes root in your mind.

if we can train in coming back to the breath, over and over again, what we are really doing is training in being present with this very moment.

#### Basic Goodness
So often people are trying to be a "good" something... When we consider this notion, good is very relative. We compare ourselves to others and use them as markers for how good we are.

Basic goodness is the view that we are not inherently bad at all; underneath our layers of confusion, pain, and aggression, we're actually basically good.

at your core you are innately wise. You are innately kind. You are innately capable.

Basic goodness, our very nature, is what we are waking up to. It is the notion that at the core of everything, we have this unwavering source of strength and power--our innate goodness.

The notion of basic goodness is that we are all capable, if we can bring ourselves to act from the point of view of our basic goodness.

"You're worth what you think you're worth."

It is always available to us, if we are able to become present enough to see it.

If we can learn to be present, to touch our basic goodness and act from it, then we can accomplish anything.

#### Tips for Practicing Meditation at Work
I recommend that people start their day with meditation, when their mind is fresh.

start off with ten minutes a day. It is said that after eleven consecutive days of doing anything, it starts to become a habit

Since we spend so much time at work, it is helpful to take moments to practice meditation throughout our day.

##### The Ding Meditation
set a time to go off once an hour.

raise my gaze, connect with my posture, and meditate for a minute.

##### The Red Dot Meditation
take red circular sticker dots and post them around my house. When I walked by one and noticed it, I would think of it as my tiny STOP sign and pause, connect with my body, pay attention to my breath for a few moments, then move on.

##### The Buddy System
mediate together for ten minutes.

The more we begin to offer ourselves the gift of meditation, both in longer sessions and in little moments throughout our day, the more we can experience the present moment and enjoy it as as opportunity to connect with our basic goodness. From there, our strong mind can support us throughout our day.

### 3. Be Who You Want to Be

#### Economic Depression and Lack of Direction
With the scarcity of opportunities in the job market, more and more people are becoming discouraged and looking for any work they can find.

#### Mapping Out Who You Want to be When You Grow Up
a mandala can be useful as a map.

It is a diagram often used in Buddhism to depict the abode of a deity or a microcosm of the universe.

#### Right Livelihood
making your living in a way that doesn't create harm.

#### You Are Not Your Job
you can always cultivate qualities that are important to you, whereas you may not always be able to make a living doing exactly what you want to do.

if you define your identity as your job, you will end up discontent.

Your life is what you make of it and what qualities you want to cultivate during your time here on earth.

#### The Bus Stop Meditation
Imagine yourself sitting on a bench, keeping an open mind. As you sit there, busses will pull up. Each bus represents a potential opportunity.

You can ask yourself, "If I got on that bus, where would I end up in five or ten years? What would my life look like?"

His ability to discern the right bus for him is a direct result of his ability to be present.

### 4. Wielding Your Speech like the Hammer of Thor
If you can shift your view so that your work is spirituality, then you can bring your meditation practice off the cushion and live your hours at work with meaning and purpose.

No matter what you do, if you bring into your work basic goodness and the qualities you wan to cultivate and let those be your guiding principles, then you will have great success.

“Being trapped by negative emotions and perpetuating then is not worldly success—it is worldly ignorance.”

When we are careless with our speech, we often end up causing harm and adding fuel to the fire of negative emotions.

#### Using Your Speech as a Weapon of Delight
The weapon we wield is our speech.

Difficulty in working with others often seems to stem from a breakdown in communication, particularly with individuals who feel that in order to be successful they need to put others down. At the heart of this type of speech is a sense of mindlessness. People get sloppy with communication and as a result cause harm.

These guidelines are known as precepts; they were particular rules that the monks and nuns would adhere to in order to maintain virtuous conduct and prevent conflict.

The basic precepts were that monastics should not take life, not take what is not offered, not engage is sexual misconduct, not engage in mindless speech, and not ingest intoxicants.

One aspect of the mindless speech precept is that one should not engage in false speech. This includes lies, gossip and slander, harsh words, and even idle speech

#### Deep Listening
when in the midst of a difficult conversation, you should open yourself up by only asking questions.

“If we cannot communicate our listening in a way that lets the other person know what we have truly understood, empathy has not occurred.”

#### More Tools for Working with Difficult People
a bodhisattva is someone who bravely engages the world from the point of view of being supremely open and awake to whatever comes their way.

a bodhisattva goes well beyond their comfort level to exert themselves on behalf of others.

someone who wants to cultivate this point of view needs to use their speech as a weapon of delight, as opposed to one of aggression.

speak from your heart. Address the topic at hand in a clear and precise manner, without letting your emotions get in the way.

> And when your mind is wild or filled with mockery,
Or filled with pride and haughty arrogance,
Or when you would expose another’s secret guilt,
To bring up old dissensions or to act deceitfully,
Or when you want to fish for praise,
Or criticize and spoil another’s name,
Or use harsh language, sparring for a fight,
It’s then that like a log you should remain.

#### The Path of Mistakes
Mistakes along the path are helpful. They are opportunities to reflect on the qualities that we long to cultivate, and to remember that it is only through practice we create perfection.

“Making one hundred different mistakes is progressive. Making one hundred of the same mistake is regressive.”

#### On Matter of Small Concern
when you sit down with someone, you can treat them as the most important person in your life for those few moments.

“Matters of great concern should be treated lightly. Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.”

When someone comes to you with an issue, they often believe it is the most important thing on your agenda as well as theirs.

To lean in and meet that person in that state of mind where they can sense that you value what they are working on is a gift.

The more we engage in this attitude of basic goodness and treating others as worthy, the more we will inspire them to join us in attempting to create a better work environment and a better society.

### 5. Russian Roulette and the Power of Just Do It
Often it is not the best-trained or most highly educated people who succeed; it’s the people who are present enough in a situation to do what simply needs to be done.

simple can understand complicated but complicated cannot understand simple. The point is that if you can slow down and be present enough, you can simplify even the most convoluted situation. However, if you walk into a complicated situation with a complicated mind, it may turn out that you continue to perpetuate trouble. Furthermore, someone who has a very set, opinionated mind may not perceive a situation clearly and will not be able to figure out simple solutions.

if we want to be successful at work, is to figure out how to be simple.

Simple here is the opposite of dumb; it is being present enough to see the brilliance available in any situation.

we are not present enough to feel our emotions fully and instead get hooked by them, attached to them, and that causes us suffering.

The purpose of meditation practice is to allow us to unhinge the bear traps of passion, aggression, and ignorance and to yank ourselves free and into the present moment.

You can leave a note for yourself somewhere on your desk or computer that simply reads *Thinking.*

The more you are able to be present, the better you will be able to handle tough situations when they arise at work.

“just do it”

when faced with a difficult scenario, we should come back to the present moment, right now, and then act from a place of mindfulness. Just doing something, and doing it properly, comes from slowing down rather than speeding up.

Entering into a difficult situation, you can either get swept up in the momentum of passion, aggression, and ignorance of you can come into the present moment and take charge of the scenario with mindfulness, simply paying attention to what is going on right now.

sometimes the best thing to do is nothing at all.

The more space we create for ourselves and others, the more clearly we are able to see a situation.

all things are impermanent and subject to change

The most important thing you can do for yourself is to practice coming back to the present, over and over again. If you can retain a fluid and flexible mind, you are less likely to become attached to passion, aggression, and ignorance when working with external factors.

We always have the option to just do it. We always have the ability to rest in spacious mind in order to make sure we are skillful in our actions. We always can put down the gun of passion, aggression, and ignorance and instead offer ourselves, as we are, knowing that through slowing down and offering space we can just do anything.

### 6. Five Slogans for Changing How You View Work
Knowing your own intention behind what you do is the difference between schlepping through your life and living a life with meaning.

“Come and see for yourself.”

Doing so keeps the Buddha’s teachings fresh and relevant; it is a living breathing set of teachings as opposed to strict dogma that we must adhere to.

*Of the two witnessnes, hold the principle one.*

there is other people’s view of you and your actions and your own view of yourself.

Trust your intuition, and lead from that perspective.

*Don’t ponder others.*

“Wasting time speculating about other people’s affairs can be toxic and self-destructive.” It does not do you any good to ponder others; it can only create harm for yourself.

*Don’t bring things to a painful point.*

Instead of avoiding discomfort, you can lean into your life and tackle difficult topics straightforwardly and mindfully.

if you find that you are avoiding something, you ought to practice meditation, bring yourself fully into the present.

*Don’t be swayed by external circumstances.*

practice mindfulness whenever and wherever possible, not just when it feels good.

So please do not think of your meditation practice as something that happens for a few minutes here and there throughout your day but something that you can continuously engage in, especially when times get tough.

*Don’t expect applause.*

just because we shouldn’t expect applause does not mean we should not applaud others. Taking delight in others’ good work is a gift to ourselves, as well as an act of kindness to the object of our admiration.

## Part Two. Mahayana: On-the-Job Compassion

### 7. Rom-Coms, Zombies, and Bodhicitta
Those moments, when we are able to transcend being a head case and relax to the point where we are not thinking solely about ourselves, feel wonderful.

The basic experience of opening up beyond just thinking about *me* and *my problems* is the basis of the Mahayana, or greater vehicle. Traditionally speaking, it is said to be greater because it transcends working just for you own benefit; it is based in taking others’ happiness as the source of your own.

#### Acknowledging Suffering
*Samsara* is a Sanskrit term that describes the continuous flow of the pain of our existence from birth until death and into birth again.

We all fall victim to this game of hope and fear.

Eight worldly dharmas:
* Pleasure and Pain
* Praise and Blame
* Fame and Disgrace
* Gain and Loss

In my own experience, when you are attached to the eight worldly dharmas…You are like a zombie in that you are going through your day wrapped in your own head, not really paying attention to the  people around you.

#### The Path of the Bodhisattva
this whole meditation thing is not just about you. It’s about helping others so that they aren’t so hooked by their own pain and drama.

It’s just the fact that our heart begins to open up to others as we realize that we are all just striving to be happy.

you can think of bodhicitta as that experience of opening your heart, or being awake enough to allow your heart to be available to any experience, good or bad.

Opening our heart in this unconditional, vulnerable way actually makes us stronger.

If we can adapt to the idea that others are actually more important than ourselves, we may find that we are less in our head and more available to our world.

A bodhisattva is someone who acts in a way that is skillful, even before action is requested.

When you offer your heart, you are also more in tune with your world.

These little moments of vulnerability are not signs of weakness to many of us, but signs that someone is human. They are signs that they are like us, and thus worthy of our empathy.

It is said that people are more likely to follow a leader if that individual is easy to relate to in some way.

### 8. Mentors and Virtue
Virtue is not based in contemporary moral standards, which, like everything else, are impermanent and subject to change over time. Instead, it refers to a bodhisattva’s ability to know what aspects of life to engage in and which to refrain from.

You can align yourself with your open heart and let that be your moral compass.

One aspect of discernment is learning what company you want to keep. 

It is through being present and open that we begin to notice whom we want to spend our time with and our energy on.

if you are spending time with someone and your negative qualities start to wane while your positive qualities blossom, then you have found someone worth spending time with.

#### Mentors as Spiritual Friends
I owe whatever knowledge I have to my mentors.

There is something about having such a spiritual friend that inspires you to think beyond your immediate situation. You are able to discern what aspects of your life you want to cultivate and to expand on them within a supportive relationship.

#### Working for the Happiness of Others
It is important that in the company we keep and the actions we perform, we hold the view that we are working for the happiness of others as well as ourselves.

faith in your own basic goodness

Virtue, in this case, is partly about developing perfect and unyielding faith in yourself.

qualities related to the development of virtue:
* steadfast in your devotion to working for others
* respect and common courtesy
* exhibit modesty and act in a humble manner
* be conscientious in all your activity discerning what is helpful or harmful

we should do all of this calmly

this is often those who work tirelessly, consistently, but slowly who accomplish the most—not the people who were the most frantic in their endeavors or the best at multitasking.

#### Slow and Steady Wins the Rage

The biggest obstacles for people interested in meditation:
* value is placed in accomplishing things quickly rather than well.
* accustomed to instant gratification

Acknowledging the choice to act in a virtuous way is just the first step on a very long journey to actualizing those decisions.

you have to be patient with yourself and attempt to work around the clock on engaging in virtue.

if you are attempting to cultivate virtue in your life, the simplest way to do it is not to drop your virtuous activity at the door when you clock out at work.

how much of my day do I spend cultivating virtue?

discern whom to spend your time with, what spiritual friends to cultivate, and how to move forward with your goals

### 9. Bombing Your Workplace with Awake
holding such an intention is only half the battle.

At a certain point you have to move from aspiring on the Mahayana path to entering it.

we actually engage in activity that allows us to do it.

so if you do aspire to develop virtue around the clock, you have to actively apply bodhicitta when you are at your desk.

It is the perfect battlefield for unleashing your personal weapon: the bomb of bodhicitta.

taking a larger view, rising above these petty distinctions, and recognizing that at our core we are all the same. We all possess basic goodness, and we all are striving to be happy.

equanimity is the view that no one is different, and so we don’t have to divide the world into us versus them; each of us deserves to feel the effects of experiencing bodhicitta.

There are six skillful activities that can unleash the bomb of bodhi, which are known as the six paramitas, or perfections.

Enlightenment does not refer to some holier plain of existence that transcends reality. It is very much reality. It is understanding reality for what it is, in each moment, and how that plays out as suffering when people are unable to see things clearly.

tools that we can use in cultivating bodhicitta:
1. *dana* (generosity)
2. *shila* (discipline)
3. *kshanti* (patience)
4. *virya* (exertion)
5. *samadhi* (meditative concentration)
6. *prajna* (wisdom)

#### Generosity
there are three traditional ways to practice generosity.

##### Giving Material Items
True generosity is simply offering, without set notions on what should happen next.

##### Giving Protection from Fear
you can offer the gift of your presence generously, without expectation.

##### Giving the Gift of Dharma
* give up improper actions
* offer your experience of it

this means showing rather than telling

Whether you are giving your material possessions, money, time, service or presence, it is about offering yourself in a way that unbinds you from your habitual way of relating to the world.

#### Discipline
there are three primary ways we can practice discipline.

##### The Discipline of Refraining from Negative Actions
This is the discipline of following through on our discernment.

##### The Discipline of Gathering Positive Actions
jot down ten positive actions that you can do at work on any given day.

Practicing discipline in this way means that you are immediately moving beyond thinking about only yourself and instead opening your heart to others.

##### The Discipline of Working for the Benefit of Sentient Beings
when we refrain from negative actions and cultivate positive ones, we apply the discipline of doing it for everyone.

doing things for people we simply don’t like

More often than not, the biggest jerks we know are the ones most in need of kindness and care.

#### Patience
It is based in relating fully with a situation, even if it annoys the hell out of you.

##### Patience in Remaining Imperturbable When Wronged
When someone wrongs you, you do not need to correct them of lash out at them. This is not a grin-and-bear-it attitude but a matter of allowing enough space into a situation to figure out how to respond in a helpful manner.

##### Patience in Happily Accepting Suffering
Patience is easy to practice when you know something is going to happen eventually; it is an asset when you don’t know what will happen next. If you can smile in the face of uncertainty, you are well trained.

##### Patience in Aspiring to a True Knowledge of Reality
based on aspiring to view life as it is

#### Exertion
applying yourself on behalf of others and rousing yourself to think about more that just your own particular situation.

##### Armor-Like Exertion
We should wear our exertion all the time, constantly remaining vigilant in seeking our opportunities to be of benefit to others.

Exert yourself beyond your comfort level.

##### Exertion in Application
the quickest way to stop feeling lost in your own head is to exert yourself on behalf of another.

##### Exertion in Benefiting Others
When you exert yourself in this manner, you make others feel good because they are experiencing relief. You feel good because you are living a life that is having an impact on other people. That is true exertion, they type that benefits both ourselves and everyone we encounter.

#### Meditative Concentration
developing concentration, which can be incredibly useful at work.

##### Concentration That Produces a Feeling of Well-Being in This Life
It may be best to cut down on multitasking and develop a feeling of well-being by brining yourself entirely to whatever is right in front of you.

##### Concentration That Gives Rise to Excellent Qualities
The most excellent quality that concentration can give rise to is a sense of awake.

##### Concentration That Benefits Sentient Beings
If you are truly present with people, they begin to feel respected and encouraged.

#### Prajna
It is wisdom that is in tune with what is. It is intelligence that is perceptive and clear. There are three main ways to let this form of intelligence guide your activity.

##### The Wisdom of Listening
The more questions you ask, the more you can see a situation for what it is. The more you listen, the more you will eventually be able to express yourself clearly to others.

##### The Wisdom of Reflecting/Contemplating
Instead of jumping into the habitual thing we all do, which is trying to present a solution of fix something, allow yourself time for wisdom to arise.


##### The Wisdom of Meditating
allow your contemplations to sink in as an act of meditation. The discursive thoughts that came up will naturally dissipate. What truths have come to you will remain. Sitting with the reality of the situation, you develop certainty in those facts. You can realize those truths in your life and work. Then you are prepared to act.

see what’s best for everyone

It is said that when we develop the perspective of prajna, all of the other paramitas are made perfect. It is the essential element that lights the fuse on the bomb of bodhi. 

### 10. Karma, the Six Realms, and Why You Should Stop Being a Jerk
Sometimes people confuse karma with fate.

The popular understanding of karma is that action and result have a one-to-one correlation

From a Buddhist point of view, karma is the law of cause and effect, which plays out over multiple lifetimes.

These multiple lifetimes are not based on an everlasting soul or being but on what is know in Sanskrit as the *alaya* (abode) consciousness.

Think of the alaya consciousness as a giant warehouse.

Your alaya, which is basically clear and neutral, gets imprinted with your virtuous and unvirtuous activity.

what you do in this life lays the ground for the future.

Whatever seeds you plant in your own mind will bear fruit appropriately.

#### The Six Realms
It may be helpful to think of them as psychological states

Whether we think of them as places we go to when we die of states of mind we experience in this lifetime, we can examine ourselves and see how we create the causes for encountering these six realms.

##### The Hell Realm
You can feel the hot and the cold, the poking and prodding, without lashing out and creating harm for yourself and others. Experiencing these strong emotional states but not giving in to them is how we sow the seeds of virtue.

##### The Hungry-Ghost Realm
jealousy and stinginess

hungry-ghost, a being who suffers from extreme hunger and thirst.

When you engage in this mentality, you are lost in desire and do not experience joy.

##### The Animal Realm
The can never truly relax, because they either need to hunt for food or are being hunted themselves.

They are unable to meditate and become familiar with their own mind, and thus are constantly yanked around by instinctual urges.

if you become familiar with your own mind through the practice of meditation, you are less likely to hunt and be hunted in this way. You can step away from bewilderment and live a life of virtue.

##### The Human Realm
The human realm is said to be the best possible birth, because we have the ability of work with our mind and become a better person.

Because we have this opportunity, we need to take advantage of it.

YOLO

You can contemplate whether you are wasting your life in distraction or pursuing virtuous activity, bettering yourself and others.

##### The Jealous-God Realm
Demigods that constantly try to wage war against the higher gods but are easily defeated.

it is better to learn to sit with your jealously and let it pass like a cloud moving across the sky instead of engaging in unvirtuous activity.

##### The God Realm
This is the reward for having engaged in virtue and accumulated a large amount of positive karma.

It is said this gradual decline is actually the most painful experience of all of the various realms of samsara. 

Since we cannot avoid impermanence, we must realize that things change and we will suffer is form of loss

The six realms are based in the same three root emotions, aggression, passion, and ignorance, discussed earlier. We become lost in the hell realm when we fall victim to anger and aggression. We wander in the hungry-ghost realm when we are stingy and passionately desirous of things we cannot have. We meander in the animal realm when we are lost in ignorance. The human realm is marked by the desire for pleasure and the desire to avoid pain. The jealous-god realm is based in aggression, specifically the aggression of acting out against beings that we perceive as having more than we do. The god realm is a place of ignorance, where we do not realize the nature of change.

The more you examine yourself, the more you will see how you wander into these various realms through the simplest of actions.

everything we do sets something else in motion.

**Exercise For Not Being a Jerk at Work**

One such concept worth contemplating is the notion that all beings have been your mother.

*This being has been my mother. I give thanks for their kindness.*

If we consider everyone we encounter as someone who has previously shown us kindness, we are less likely to be a jerk and more willing to love unconditionally, in the office and throughout our day.

### 11. Three Steps for Creating Social Change through Inner Change
one of the most important factors for the millennial generation when looking for a job was that they felt the work they are doing is meaningful.

I had become the problem, as opposed to the solution, by letting my rage fuel my actions in the midst of a protest. I did not represent the peace I wanted to see in the world that day, only the fear and chaos that was engulfing it.

Regardless of the story line, the point of our meditation practice is to recognize the underlying emotions and, before getting caught up in them, to see them as impermanent.

we should strive to be the change we want to see in the world.

“Fighting for peace is like screwing for virginity.”

#### Step 1: Cutting Through Fixed Views
The problem with these fixed views is that they are the basis for dualistic thinking. If you go into the world with the notion that you opinions are better than everyone else’s and try to force them down people’s throats, you are only propagating aggression.

By continuously coming back to the present, we are learning to free ourselves from fixed points of view. That is an important first step in creating change, at work and in society.

#### Step 2. Raising Your Gaze
As you are freed from just listening to and expounding upon your own fixed view, you become more available to notice the emotional turmoil of those around you.

In his article, “Innovation Starts with Empathy,” Dev Patnaik points out that the quickest and most effective way for a company to prosper is for its leaders to develop empathy for the world around them.

come to understand the priorities and goals of your target audience and you will be more successful in targeting them in the long run.

the more we can empathize with coworkers, clients, and even superiors, the better we will be able to understand them.

#### Step 3: Compassionate Activity
Instead of trying to yell our ideas for societal change into existence, we have the opportunity to infiltrate the same organizations we see to transform and create the change from within.

“When meeting difficult situations, one should dash forward bravely and with joy.”

So let’s all please step up and help this world progress further toward compassion and empathy. It’s not up to some elusive “them”—it’s up to us.

### 12. Five Slogans for Empathy and Compassion
Every day, you have an impact on others in either a positive of a negative way. It is up to you to decide if you want to overcome whatever sense of apathy you may feel today and rouse yourself to engage in virtuous activity, or if you prefer to sink into lazy self-centeredness.

If you can move beyond thinking only about yourself and open op to an empathetic point of view, then you will be able to come home from work and feel good about the life you are living.

The following five slogans seem particularly relevant to keeping and open heart at work.

*When the world is filled with evil, transform all mishaps into the path of bodhi.*

it is easy to keep an open heart when we are surrounded by puppies and loving friends and family. When we are confronted with bona fide evil, particularly in the workplace, it is difficult to maintain a sense of bodhi. 

When in the belly of the beast, you can create tremendous positive change simply by taking whatever comes up at work as an opportunity to exhibit the power of an open heart.

you have a flashlight in your pocket

*Whatever you meet unexpectedly, join with meditation.*

There is an innocent quality here, where we allow our meditation just to be available to accommodate whatever might arise, whether it is good or bad, for us or against us. We don’t discriminate. It is all fodder for our journey.

“Whatever shakes you should without delay, right away, be incorporated into the path.”

*Don’t act with a twist.*

be straightforward in all your workplace interactions as well as your meditation practice.

The best way to do that is to set aside your me-based thinking and look to benefit your organization as a whole.

*Change your attitude, but remain neutral.*

instead of hoarding our kindness and compassion, we must offer it at all times, to all beings.

We should not get hyped up about trying to embrace all beings and kick ourselves when we shy away from absolute empathy.

*Be grateful to everyone.*

they have given you the opportunity to practice breaking your habitual patterns and developing empathy.

stop complaining.

complaining doesn’t help anyone; it only furthers negativity. Instead of complaining, you should seek out solutions to whatever problems ail you.

“If someone hurts you, you should be thankful to them for giving you the opportunity to practice.”

#### Emptiness + Compassion = Positive Change
Emptiness, then, means that the world and all of us, its inhabitants, are not what we think they are. We are all actually ever-changing conglomerations of skin and bone and sweat and tears and thoughts and emotions. To take any of us seriously would be silly. With that in mind, emptiness can be viewed as an experience wherein we realize we can approach our life and world with an open heart and a sense of humor.

Combining our experience of emptiness with our experience of compassion allows us to fluidly engage with our environment and create positive change in the world around us.

The top regret was, “I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”

By living in accord with the practices of mindfulness and compassion, you have a much better shot at creating change that is meaningful, without forcing or changing major aspects of who you are.

## Part Three. Mahayana: Six Tools for Compassionate Leadership

### 13. Benevolence, or Bashing Aggression with the Velvet Hammer
* we can’t do everything
* we can’t do it all alone

A fundamental principle of leadership is that we need to engage others, work with their skill sets, and encourage the people with whom we collaborate.

Six Ways of Ruling

These six methods of leadership come under the Mahayana purview of working in a way that benefits everyone we meet.

The Six Ways of Ruling are based in the idea that we are all already the king.

if you acknowledge your own basic goodness and worthiness, you are truly regal.

you can consider your home environment, your work environment, or your social environment in the same regal manner as a king would survey his land from his throne.

You can live in a way that has a profound effect on others, as your brilliance radiates out and is of benefit to the world as a whole.

The Six Ways of Ruling are about being benevolent, true, genuine, fearless, artful, and rejoicing.

They teach that each of us has the ability to lead others, once we develop a sense of confidence in our innate wisdom.

Putting others’ happiness before your own is a surefire way to earn the trust of your coworkers and creates fluid communication among everyone.

A leader who is grounded in this form of confidence is often well regarded because people know them to be worthy of respect

when you engage your work with certainty in your own wisdom and a desire to be helpful, people are naturally drawn to you.

#### A Path of Service
Leadership is the Shambala tradition is not an opportunity for personal gain.

You have to take care of yourself, or you can’t continue to be helpful to others.

Good leaders are also humble.

it is a wonderful opportunity to serve others.

#### Joining Heaven and Earth
you have to join the day-to-day details of earth with a larger vision for what could be, which is referred to heaven.

a leader can simultaneously hold a long-term vision and act in a way that accomplishes what needs to happen right now.

“What a leader does for followers is turn anxiety into confidence.”

the best way to judge a leader is by analyzing the people whom he or she leads. doubt or confidence?

#### The Benevolent Leader
benevolence is actively engaging kindness so that the lives of the people you are leading are changed for the better.

They are open to other people’s perspectives and recognize other points of view.

You have to go beyond the dictionary meaning of *benevolent* and put yourself in other people’s shoes by practicing empathy.

#### Gentleness and Humor
gentleness and humor will end up being your best tools for combating everyday confusion and aggression in the workplace.

The Velvet Hammer

The hammer is a tool that accomplishes what needs to get done. The velvet makes it soft, gentle, and thus people are more likely to respect it.

A leader who is benevolent knows that aggression helps no one.

Often when you offer space to someone, their aggression naturally fizzles. You are not pouring fuel on the fire of their anger, and without it, the heat of aggression gradually fades out.

“Are you still angry about me carrying the woman?” he asked. “I Left her on the shore hours ago, but because of your anger, you have been carrying her this entire time.”

Instead of meeting someone on the battlefield of aggression, you can meet them in the spacious playground of share innate wisdom.

You can be a benevolent leader and, when faced with aggression, bash through it with the gentleness of a velvet hammer.

### 14. True, or How to Be Steady as a Mountain
Benevolence is the foundation of the qualities of true. Through gentleness and the directness of speaking a true statement, you are giving weight to your words. You are giving them power by allowing the qualities of true to shine forth.

Really being true, then, simply means being in tune with your core wisdom.

When you have conviction in basic goodness, you develop a sense of weightiness

You can be as steadfast as a mountain when you experience the strength of your basic goodness.

if you want to lead others, you need to let go of the notion that you can do everything at once. You need to focus, bringing yourself fully to whatever task is at hand or meeting is taking place, rather than strategizing about all the other things you could be doing.

#### An Unwavering Presence
Olympic athletes have devoted years to becoming one-pointed at very specific tasks.

true is always acting from that sense of self confidence.

It is confidence that everyone possesses basic goodness and that therefore you will be able to resolve whatever issue arises.

When you are true to yourself in this way, you spontaneously act with integrity.

Often our best friends are the ones who are unconditionally there for us.

#### Natural Diplomacy
power is best used when everyone profits from it—when we share it and empower others. True power, in this sense, is that you can see what people need in any given moment, and because you are true they trust you are acting on their behalf.

charismatic behavior can be broken down into three basic elements: presence, power, and warmth.

When you are true, there is no *them* that we need to conquer or subjugate; there is only us.

As you exhibit the steadfast presence, the stable power, and the genuine warmth of being true, people will grow and trust and respect you. You will be able to lead with skill, supported by your coworkers and colleagues.

### 15. Genuine, or Pointing to the Stars
Genuine in this sense is not just being clear and direct. It involves pointing out the exact nature of things. You are pointing to reality in an indisputable manner.

Genuine is based in knowing what is in your mind and heart, which it true, and not being afraid of it. We can genuinely be who we are. We can genuinely lead others in a way that everyone appreciates. We can even genuinely make mistakes. All of this is okay when it is rooted in our innate goodness.

Genuine is pointing out whatever truth exists behind mixed expectations or set opinions.

It is highlighting your own wisdom and creating a map for others to discover their own.

I mapped out the logic behind why I was doing what I was doing.

#### Working With Intimidation
If they are bullshitting their way through work, your genuine presence only illuminates that fact.

if you are lost in your own sense of they way things should be, and not realizing they way they are, then you are merely displaying your ideas and opinions, which is not necessarily genuine either.

By offering your genuineness, even in uncomfortable positions ore when you are calling people out, you are offering them the chance to follow your lead and act in the same manner.

“We are what we repeatedly do.”

“Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.”

you have to repeatedly come back to the idea that you want to be genuine with others.

#### Giving Up Genuineness
It is that we are able to see a clear course of action and point to it. Point out the logic of a situation is always about benefitting others.

That is what is meant by giving up genuineness: since it does not belong to us, we are readily available to offer it to the world at large.

**Mantra Exercise for Authenticity**
*Mantra* is a Sanskrit word that can be translated a “to protect the mind.”

take out a male and silently recite and contemplate the word *patience* 108 times.

choose the phrase that makes the most sense to you as an antidote to whatever emotional disturbance you’re currently experiencing.

Whenever you engage in this practice, take a moment at the end of your recitation to raise your gaze and rest with whatever feeling has arisen.

To take the time to count recitations of *benevolence, gentleness, presence, or warmth* may bring you back to the present moment and your connection with your basic goodness. From that point, you are returning to your most authentic you, and you can continue to practice being genuine.

### 16. Fearlessness, or Being Decisive in an Indecisive World
The Six Ways of Ruling are divided into two broad categories: just and powerful. The first three principles—benevolent, true, and genuine—are about manifesting in a way that feels just when working with others. The next three qualities fall under the heading of powerful. All six embody the Mahayana aspiration of helping all beings we encounter.

the way to wild power well is to wield it for the good of all.

true power comes from working for the welfare of others. That is the type of power we can respect.

We can express our power at any time.

Fearlessness is about looking at our fear, learning it well, and seeing our way through it. We must become familiar with our fear if we want to experience fearlessness.

Fearlessness is based in the idea that in order to truly deal with your phobias, you need to confront them with an open heart and mind.

#### Fear on the Meditation Cushion
Fear is powered by story lines, and fearlessness is powered by innate goodness. The former comes and goes; the other is part of us.

When those fears come up, the instruction is to label them *thinking* and return our attention to our breathing.

try to locate the fear within the body.

Try to identify where the emotion resides.

contemplations like this point out how ephemeral these emotional states actually are.

#### Overcoming Hesitancy
“Fear is a state of mind. Fearlessness is our nature.” It is much better to reset in our nature than to engage a state of mind that only causes us suffering.

If you can move beyond uncertainty in your basic goodness, then you can move beyond hesitation in making whatever decisions need to be made.

#### Not Knowing What Will Happen Next
“A warrior accepts that we can never know what will happen to us next.”

If you aim to be a compassionate leader, the best thing to do is acknowledge what you will never know how things will work out. Fearlessness is the face of uncertainty is a powerful weapon for good.

Fear will always arise in new forms as we go about our lives. To embrace it when it arises not as obstacle but as journey is a brilliant learning experience. From this, we can help others do the same. Once we recognize that our natural state is basically fearless, we can inspire confidence in others.

### 17. Artfulness, or Arranging Your Kingdom
Ruling our work situation is art, not a science.

pick colleagues whose strengths balance out your weak points.

We all want to work with someone who is being authentic, who receives situations clearly, and who we trust will put us to work in the manner most befitting our skills. That is when artfulness matters the most.

#### The Right People for the Right Positions
Skill sets can be easily taught; things like presence and communication are harder to train someone in.

This aspect of artfulness is sometimes referred to as arranging your kingdom. Imagine your life as a kingdom, with you as the monarch. Knowing you cannot do everything or be everywhere, you need to appoint certain people as ministers, others as generals, others as educators, and so on, so that everyone has their rightful place in the kingdom based on their unique abilities.

You can build your whole life out in this manner, artfully discerning who should play what role in order for everything to work seamlessly.

“In most cases being a good boss means hiring talented people and then getting out of their way.”

The artful leader cares about the people they are leading and wants to know them intimately.

#### Timing, Space, and Communication
Timing is an important element of being artful. It you want your work to flow seamlessly, you need to know when to act and when to give space to a situation.

An artful leader is one who gives others the space to discover their own wisdom.

The more we empower our employees in a supportive manner, the more we are able to accomplish together.

Another aspect of artfulness is knowing when not to act at all.

The more space you give other people to discover their wisdom—even if that messes with your preconceived notions of what ought to be happening—the more they will come to trust and respect you.

The artful leader’s consideration for others goes beyond just knowing details about their lives; it involves thinking through exactly what each person needs to know and how best to convert that information.

Artful communication is a form of compassion. We feel good engaging in it, and it is a way to share our heart clearly with other people. In difficult times, it helps others feel respected.

We can’t rule our work or our life situation single-handedly. We need to rely on people. A skillful leader sees the unique qualities in others and places them in positions that allow them to shine and feel empowered, while bettering the situation at hand. Through artfully handling our timing and communication, we learn to make our life function life a well-oiled machine. We become powerful, operating seamlessly in our work in a way that provides comfort to others and benefit to all.

### 18. Rejoicing, or It’s Okay to Party
We have a knack for dwelling on all the upsets that come our way, complaining about our inconveniences, instead of celebrating everything that we have going for us.

it is foolish that we waste so much time complaining about what we do not have instead of rejoicing in our good fortune.

rejoice the various positive elements of your life and recognize the small occasions for rejoicing that take place throughout your day.

**Exercise for Rejoicing**
just sit down on your bed and meditate on the question *What have I done today that I can be proud of?*

After reviewing what you wrote, raise your gaze and relax with whatever emotion may be present. That is rejoicing.

#### Your World is Magic
With the view that everyone and everything we encounter is rooted in basic goodness, we can find magic in any situation.

If we encounter obstacles in our home or work life, they should be celebrated; they remind us of everything we already have within and around us. We can be grateful for their existence and rejoice that we can practice meditative mind at all.

Come to realize the ephemeral quality of emotions and let them roll down your back.

This ability to rejoice in the midst of great pressure is one of the things that make the Sakyong an incredible leader.

#### Celebration
A good happy hour seems to be marked by appreciating one another freely, outside of the confines for the habitual work dynamic, A bad happy hour seems to be marked by a perpetuation of the worst aspects of office behavior, including gossip and slander. Particularly when alcohol is tossed into the mix, it is hard to get people to say in the zone of appreciation and not slip into complaining about the same old garbage.

“Celebration is an attitude.”

It is an attitude of appreciating our life as it is.

Rejoicing is a direct outcome of combining the previous five methods of leadership.

if you live a life of mindfulness and empathy, you may simply find yourself becoming a leader, as others come to trust you and are magnetized to you.

## Part Four. Vajrayana: Be Awake for Each Moment

### 19. Developing Confidence
The Buddhist path is realizing that you are infinitely capable and then developing faith in that notion.

*Varayana* is a Sanskrit term. *Vajra* can be translated as “diamond” or “indestructible”; *yana*, as we know, means “vehicle.”

Our wakefulness, this basically good state, can never be destroyed.

we don’t have to be confused or uncertain; we can experience our goodness and act from that powerful place.

it is a way of life. It is the path of developing certainty in our goodness.

when we develop the right skillful means, we can live a life based entirely in the nature of awake.

#### Upaya
*upaya* is a Sanskrit term that can be translated as “expedient or skillful means.”

When we employ ape, we are acting in accord with reality, as opposed to fighting it.

In today’s world, engaging in the process of slowing down and discovering that you aren’t, in fact, basically struggling and pitiful but are instead good and worthy is countercultural.

If we long to be our most authentic self, then we need to overcome this obstacle and develop true confidence in our own goodness and our unique abilities.

**Exercise in Examining Labels**
you are not your obstacles.

sit with the question *What labels do I place on myself?*

Whatever comes up, note in on your paper.

These labels change constantly.

A core belief in the Buddhist tradition is *anatman*, a Sanskrit term that translates as “not-self.” It is the idea that you are not the set, solid being that you think you are. You are a fluid, constantly evolving and changing person who can play a variety of roles and embody a variety of qualities over time. You are not a permanent expression of the labels you put on yourself but more of a fluid entity that shifts in accordance with what comes up in your life.

#### Working Skillfully With Obstacles
How we respond to obstacles is what actually defines us.

when you face an obstacle, you should think of it in the same impermanent, fluid way.

acknowledge the obstacles and upheavals that come your way, but you do not need to let them weigh you down.

### 20. It’s Hard Out Here for a Pimp: Right Livelihood Revisited
appearances are not the issue, attachment to them is

coemergent wisdom

this famous pimp achieved awakening by taking on humble work, committing fully to it, and making it a part of his spiritual practice.

we can switch our view of work so that everything we encounter is considered a part of our path.

#### Three Lessons From Tilopa’s Story
The first is his commitment to practice.

That leads us to the second moral: Tilopa went to work as a pimp for a specific reason at a specific time in a specific place.

we can pinpoint the work that will help us develop in a spiritual capacity.

Tilopa’s motivation was spiritual awakening. Though his work is illegal in today’s world, it led him and others to enlightenment.

we need to consider our livelihood from the perspective of how it can help us to hammer away at our neurosis, instead of encouraging it.

The third moral of the story of Tilopa…is that we may be surprised by the effect this level of commitment has on others.

Because you are living a spiritual life while you’re on the clock, other people are picking up on your energy and may start acting in a similar manner, whether they are aware of it or not.

#### The Six Words of Advice
*Don’t recall, or Let go of what has passed.*

Dwelling in what has already passed is like living in a cinema. You may get some sort of satisfaction from the experience, but eventually the lights come up and you return to a reality that differs from the one you had been enjoying.

*Don’t imagine, or Let go of what may come.*

Similarly, there is no need to project what may happen tomorrow or the next day.

*Don’t think, or Let go of what is happening now.*

Don’t fixate on what is going on right now, overanalyzing it to no end.

*Don’t examine, or Don’t try to figure anything out.*

Don’t feel like you need to intellectualize anything.

*Don’t control, or Don’t try to make anything happen.*

give up the idea that you have to control anything at all.

*Rest, or Relax, right now, and rest.*

In the present moment we should not think too much about what’s going on. We should not try to fix anything, or make anything happen, or figure out what anything means.

We should just relax and rest with right now. We should just be available to the present moment.

### 21. Let Go of My Ego
In the Buddhist content, *giving up* means that you are surrendering everything that is holding you back from experiencing reality in a direct and pure manner. Surrendering is viewed as positive. We are surrendering everything that stops us from being available to the teachings of the Buddha. We are giving up anything that might block the radio signal of the dharma.

giving up is about letting go of every set self-image we project onto ourselves and all preconceived notions of our work and our world, but emptying ourselves of our our personal garbage.

we need to give up territory. The strongest and most efficient leaders I know are the ones who are artful enough to drop their own sense of what needs to happen and empower other people to make things run smoothly.

In order to give up territory, you need to not take things so personally.

We should be diligent in considering how our preconceived notions of self and others hold us back from experiencing the world as it is.

#### The Guru
Guru is a Sanskrit term which can be translated as “teacher” or “master.” A true guru is an individual who has fully let go of their ego, embraced a set of teachings, and embodies those teachings in a real and living manner.

we should be wary of whom we choose as a teacher.

Be sure that they are someone genuine who embodies wisdom and doesn’t just possess an intellectual understanding of the teachings.

#### Our Life as Teacher
look to your own life situations as opportunities for processing your neuroses.

Instead of relying on others for your inner transformation, you can look at every situation in your life as a chance to explore where you are still hanging on to emotional attachment.

#### Offering
There are three aspects of offering in this way: body, speech, and mind.

By diving head first into any project that arises, you are giving of yourself without hesitation.

Giving up your speech means that you are using it to the best of your ability to be helpful to the situation.

You can let go of me-based thinking completely.

we are letting go, relaxing into the situation by surrendering completely to it. 

#### Trust
We have to trust our own basic goodness as well as that of other people.

**An On-the-Spot Practice for Giving Up**

you should never shoot down a situation but instead support it, offering yourself to it.

surrender to the situation

You leap in an say yes and add whatever value you can to the scenario.

### 22. Strippers, Life Coaches, and Cultivating an Authentic Presence
the aim of Shambhala Buddhist training is to “become a real person who can help others.”

We are becoming more awake to our basic nature, our own goodness and worthiness, and thus are able to be helpful to the world at large.

The idea of basic goodness is that more you is exactly what this world needs. When you are your most authentic self, you can serve the world in a powerful way. You can offer the most potent aspects of who you actually are. As we develop conviction in our basic goodness through our work and surrender our neurosis, we become not different but more authentic.

When you exhibit this authentic presence, people are magnetized to you.

Authentic Presence:
* understand cause and effect (outer)
* letting go (inner)

accept and cherish every aspect of who we are.

#### Windhorse
at any time we can ride the wind, or energy, or our life, just as we would a horse.

#### The Life Coach and The Stripper 
whatever work you do…if you have the right motivation, conviction in bringing you practice to your work, and artfulness, you can be of benefit.

We can learn from their example and in turn become more authentically who we are. We can become truly comfortable in our skin and wield the power or our presence in a way that brings delight and relaxation to others. We can contact our basic goodness and ride the energy of that experience. When we are able to authentically do all of that, we magnetize the resources we need and provide inspiration to others.

### 23. Five Slogans for Increasing Conviction in Your Natural State
drop the barrier between your work and meditation practice.

The Vajrayana path shares in the Mahayana vision of working toward awakening in order to be of benefit to others.

*Rest in the nature of alaya, the essence.*

simply maintain a sense of bare awareness without thinking about anything or forcing the mind into a concentrated state.

*In post meditation, be a child of illusion.*

bring that mindfulness and compassion off the cushion and into your everyday life.

we can perceive whatever we encounter as sacred and magical, simply be being present to its reality.

*All dharma agrees at one point.*

the unifying aspect of everything the Buddha ever taught is the imperative to overcome our own ignorance of self and of reality. 

shed our habitual layers of ego and surrender to the way things are.

It is that process of giving up everything, so that you can accommodate anything.

*Abandon any hope of fruition*
abandon any fixed idea about what will happen in our practice or in our work life. The meaning of this slogan is that we should not be so focused on results.

letting go of our preconceived notions of how something might work out.

don’t focus on results, focus on the process.

*Train wholeheartedly.*

We need to be single-minded in bringing our full and most authentic self to every moment in our life.

When we have this level of commitment, we will end up living every day from the perspective of our inherent worthiness, our awake state.

When you live a life in touch with your basic goodness, you are unstoppable. There is nothing you cannot accomplish in our out of the workplace. When you work with your own mind and work to benefit others, it almost doesn’t matter what career path you choose; you are already engaging your world wholeheartedly and will be successful in the most meaningful sense.

Through practicing these qualities, you can manifest as the practitioner this world needs. You can be present and engage your life as it is. You can join work and practice in a way that is true to your own noble, open heart. You can lead others with their welfare in mind and utilize these paths as a course of becoming awake. Please do it, because the world needs more leaders like you.
